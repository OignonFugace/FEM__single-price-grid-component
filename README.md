## My process

### What I learned & Useful ressources 
- CSS Grid.
- Proper use of semantics HTML elements. 
	- [HTML section elements are a lie (sort of) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULdkpU51hTQ)
		- [HTML Sectioning Elements: ARIA Landmarks Example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/landmarks/HTML5.html)
		- A `section` is being marked a a `region` only when it has a `title`, or better : reference the title of the section with an `id` on the title and `aria-labelledby="the-title-id"`.
		- Hence section must have a heading in them.
		- `aria-label` is another possibility.
